# Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to make a sales pattern analysis and customer analysis which would be leading to more accurate forecasting and quotas. The sales pattern analysis focuses on finding trends within sales data, which can help you better understand your product demand. The goal of customer analytics is to create a single, accurate view of an organization's customer base, which can inform decisions about how to best acquire and retain future customers. It can also identify high-value customers and suggest proactive ways to interact with them.

The pandemic has accelerated the shift towards a more digital world and triggered changes in online shopping behaviors that are likely to have lasting effects. An interesting side effect was how quickly brand loyalty fell by the wayside. In fact, 40% of consumers said they switched brands during the pandemic, according to McKinsey & Company research.

So, it's important to allow business owners to derive value from data and make informed decisions. Data analytics in e-commerce not only helps company owners better understand their clients but also forecast consumer behavior patterns and increase revenue.
 
Through this project, companies identify their most and least performant products, monitor buyer and consumer behavior, and determine which issues impact the business. And also used by e-commerce professionals to improve both sales and the customer experience, but can also be used by inventory managers for fulfillment and by accountants to track costs and profitability.
